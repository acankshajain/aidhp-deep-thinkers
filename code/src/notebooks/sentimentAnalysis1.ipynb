    "# === Financial GenAI Recommender PoC ===\n",
    "# Author: ChatGPT + User Collaboration\n",
    "# Description: Full PoC pipeline for personalized financial recommendations using text-based user input.\n",
    "# Covers: Sentiment Analysis, Intent Detection, Keyword Extraction, Rule-Based Recommendation, Gradio UI\n",
    "\n",
    "# === Assumptions ===\n",
    "# 1. No internet access: All models must run locally (TextBlob, sklearn, etc.)\n",
    "# 2. No OpenAI API or HuggingFace API used (but prompt templates are LLM-friendly)\n",
    "# 3. Dataset: We'll use a small simulated list of user messages as the input\n",
    "# 4. Model training is skipped in favor of prompt-style logic and local ML components\n",
    "# 5. Product/Content recommendations are mocked via keyword/intent mapping\n",
